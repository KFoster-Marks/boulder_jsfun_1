#[fit]Clarify
#[fit]the **What** and
#[fit]the **Why**

^ Setting your brain up for learning.  We post the objectives, but you can do this yourself.  

^Whiteboard exercise - pick something you always wanted to learn, and write some "objectives" you might use during a study session.

^Post them to slack

#[fit] Process
#[fit] *over*
#[fit] product

^Procrastination happens when you worry about product.

^Example - Writing the short story vs writing for the next 20 minutes.

^Turn and Talk and give an example of product vs process.

^ Defining success as simply spending time doing focused and deliberate practice. 

^ This program is going to be very difficult at times. You may not fully understand some of the concepts on the first try. And you may not reach your end goal in the period of time that you set out to do your work. 

^ This is perfectly fine so long as you're challenging yourself to get better while in the zone of proximal development.

#[fit] Have fun!

^Stand Up - talk to someone across the room and talk about the importance of fun with learning.

^Imagine that same friend from earlier asks you, "Hey, what's this play business all about? Why is that important? How do you do that?" Take a few moments to think about what you'd say to your friend. When you've decided what to say, turn and talk to a partner and share your thoughts with them. Since you've been sitting for a while, feel free to stand up and stretch your legs too.

^Blooms Taxonomy is a framework for teachers to focus on higher order thinking.

^It is like a stairway - where each level represents a higher level of thinking.

^If a student masters a higher level, then it is assumed they have mastered the lower levels.
